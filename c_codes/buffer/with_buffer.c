/*
 * A buffer is temporary storage used to store input and output commands.
 * All input and output commands are buffered in the operating systemâ€™s buffer.
 * C uses a buffer to output or input variables.
 * The buffer stores the variable that is supposed to be taken in (input) or sent out (output) of the program.
 * A buffer needs to be cleared before the next input is taken in.
